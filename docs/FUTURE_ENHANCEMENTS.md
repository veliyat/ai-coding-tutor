# Future Enhancements

A planning and execution guide for upcoming features and improvements.

---

## Adaptive Learning Features

### Contextual Video Resources
**Current**: Text-based lessons only
**Goal**: Curated video content that reinforces concepts

- Embed relevant tutorial videos within lesson content
- Match videos to specific coding problems/concepts
- Short clips (2-5 min) for quick reinforcement
- Full tutorials for deeper exploration
- Sources: YouTube educational channels, custom recordings

### Adaptive Topic Progression
**Current**: Fixed linear curriculum
**Goal**: Dynamic path based on learner readiness

- Start with ONE core concept per session
- Assess comprehension before introducing new material
- Detect mastery signals (speed, accuracy, confidence)
- Unlock next topic only when current is solid
- Avoid overwhelming with multiple concepts at once

### Interest-Based Next Steps
**Current**: Predetermined lesson order
**Goal**: Suggest what will engage the learner most

- Track which exercises sparked curiosity (time spent, re-attempts)
- Identify patterns: does learner prefer logic puzzles, visual output, real-world apps?
- Recommend next lesson based on interest signals
- "You might enjoy this next..." suggestions
- Balance interest with foundational requirements

---

## MVP Expansion Features

### Multi-Language Support
**Current**: JavaScript only
**Goal**: Add Python, TypeScript, and potentially Java

- Language selector in editor
- Language-specific sandbox execution (Worker-based for isolation)
- Curriculum content per language
- Syntax highlighting and IntelliSense per language

### Interactive Database Learning
**Current**: No database topics
**Goal**: Hands-on MongoDB and PostgreSQL learning with real database terminals

Leverage free tiers of cloud database services to give learners a real terminal-like experience:

**Approach:**
- User creates their own free tier account (MongoDB Atlas / Supabase) as part of the exercise
- User provides connection credentials (API keys / connection strings) in the app
- Terminal-like interface connects to their actual database instance
- Real query execution with immediate feedback

**MongoDB Atlas Integration:**
- Free tier: 512MB storage, shared cluster
- Teach: CRUD operations, aggregation pipelines, indexing
- Terminal emulates `mongosh` experience
- Exercises: Build collections, query documents, design schemas

**Supabase/PostgreSQL Integration:**
- Free tier: 500MB database, 2 projects
- Teach: SQL fundamentals, joins, transactions, RLS policies
- Terminal emulates `psql` experience
- Exercises: Create tables, write queries, understand relational design

**Benefits:**
- Real database experience, not simulated
- Students own their data and can continue experimenting
- Teaches cloud service setup (valuable skill)
- No backend infrastructure costs for us

**Security Considerations:**
- Credentials stored client-side only (localStorage)
- Clear guidance on free tier limitations
- Warn users not to store sensitive data
- Connection validation before storing credentials

### Mobile Optimization
**Current**: Desktop-first
**Goal**: Responsive experience across devices

- Collapsible panels for lesson content, editor, and tutor
- Touch-friendly code editor controls
- Bottom sheet for tutor on mobile
- Swipe gestures for panel navigation

### Branching Lesson Paths
**Current**: Linear lesson flow
**Goal**: Adaptive, non-linear curriculum

- Prerequisite system for lessons
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment based on performance
- Optional challenge exercises
- "Choose your path" decision points

### Gamification
**Current**: Phase 2 (XP, Levels, Streaks, Achievements) complete
**Goal**: Engagement and motivation features
**Spec**: See `docs/PERSONALIZED_LEARNING.md` for full implementation plan

**Progress**:
- [x] Event bus architecture for decoupled data flow
- [x] Exercise attempt persistence to database
- [x] Database triggers for progress aggregation
- [x] XP/points system (Phase 2)
- [x] Daily streak counter (Phase 2)
- [x] Achievement badges (Phase 2)
- [ ] Dashboard redesign (Phase 3)

**Known improvements**:
- [ ] Show achievements immediately from Edge Function response instead of refetching from DB (reduces notification delay)

### Social Features
**Current**: None
**Goal**: Community and peer learning

- Share progress/solutions with privacy controls
- Study groups
- Per-lesson discussion threads
- Peer code review (optional)

### COPPA Compliance
**Current**: Not implemented
**Goal**: Legal compliance for users under 13
**Spec**: See `docs/PERSONALIZED_LEARNING.md` for detailed consent flow

- Age gate during onboarding
- Parental consent email flow for under-13 users
- Parent oversight dashboard (future)
- Sound defaults OFF for children
- Data collection disclosure

---

## Multi-Subject Platform Vision

> Long-term vision (1+ years): Expand beyond JavaScript to a unified learning platform.

### Platform Architecture Decision
**Decision**: Single unified platform with subject categories (not separate apps)

**Rationale**:
- Kids 7+ benefit from single app (easier to use, parents prefer)
- Unified gamification = more XP sources = more engagement
- Shared infrastructure reduces development effort
- Cross-subject learning connections possible

### Subject Categories

**Programming (Playground-based)**:
- JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, HTML/CSS
- All share the same "Playground" editor with language selector
- Unified sandbox infrastructure, consistent UX

**Non-Coding Subjects (Custom interfaces)**:
- Chess → Chess Board component
- Music Theory → Piano/Staff notation
- English → Text/Quiz interface
- Mathematics → Formula editor + Quiz

### Database Schema Evolution

When ready to implement:
```sql
-- New: Subject/Domain concept
subjects (
  id, slug, title, description,
  category,             -- 'programming' | 'other'
  interface_type,       -- 'playground' | 'chess_board' | 'piano' | 'quiz'
  icon, color
)

-- Updated: Module belongs to subject
modules (
  id, subject_id,       -- NEW: foreign key
  title, slug, sequence_order
)

-- Updated: Per-subject progression
student_subject_progress (
  id, student_id, subject_id,
  xp_total, current_level,
  lessons_completed, total_time_seconds
)
```

### Naming Convention
| Current Name | New Name | Reason |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Editor | **Playground** | More playful, kid-friendly, applies to all programming languages |

### What NOT to Build Now
- Subject management UI
- Multiple subject interfaces (chess, music, etc.)
- Cross-subject analytics
- Subject selection/switching
- Multi-language Playground (Python, etc.)

## Technical Improvements

### Testing Infrastructure
**Current**: ✅ Implemented (400+ tests)
**Priority**: High (COMPLETE)
**Docs**: See `docs/TESTING.md` for full testing guide

#### Recommended Stack

**Unit/Integration Tests: Vitest + React Testing Library**
Vitest is the optimal choice for Vite + React projects:
- Native Vite integration (shares config, transforms, and plugins)
- Jest-compatible API (familiar syntax, easy migration paths)
- Fast HMR-based watch mode for rapid development
- Built-in TypeScript support without additional configuration
- First-class ESM support

```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom @vitest/coverage-v8
```

**E2E Tests: Playwright (recommended over Puppeteer)**
Playwright offers significant advantages:
- Multi-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit/Safari)
- Superior TypeScript integration
- Built-in auto-waiting (more reliable than manual waits)
- Excellent Vite integration via `@playwright/test`
- Parallel test execution out of the box
- Built-in test generator and trace viewer for debugging

```bash
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

**Alternative: Puppeteer** (if Chrome-only or specific CI requirements)
- Chrome/Chromium-focused
- Lower-level API, more control
- Smaller bundle if only Chrome is needed

```bash
npm install -D puppeteer jest-puppeteer @types/puppeteer
```

#### Testing Strategy: Local Supabase vs Mocking

**Prefer Local Supabase** for integration and E2E tests:
```bash
supabase start   # Spins up local Postgres, Auth, Edge Functions
```

Benefits of local Supabase:
- Tests real RLS policies
- Tests actual auth flows
- Tests Edge Functions locally
- Catches bugs that mocks would miss
- Already part of the dev workflow

| Test Type | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Unit (pure logic) | No DB needed, or minimal mocking |
| Integration (hooks, queries) | Local Supabase |
| E2E (Playwright) | Local Supabase |
| CI pipeline | Local Supabase via `supabase start` |

**Mocking** — use sparingly, only for:
- Pure utility functions (e.g., `access-code.ts` string generation)
- Simulating specific error states (network failure, timeout)
- Component render tests that don't need real data

```typescript
// src/test/mocks/supabase.ts (for edge cases only)
import { vi } from 'vitest'

export const mockSupabaseError = {
  from: vi.fn(() => ({
    select: vi.fn().mockRejectedValue(new Error('Network error')),
  })),
}
```

#### Test Environment Setup

**Local development & CI test environment:**
```bash
# .env.test (points to local Supabase)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<local-anon-key-from-supabase-start>
```

**Seed data for tests:**
```bash
# supabase/seed.sql - runs automatically with supabase start
INSERT INTO modules (id, title, slug, order_index) VALUES
  ('test-module-1', 'Test Module', 'test-module', 1);

INSERT INTO lessons (id, module_id, title, slug, order_index) VALUES
  ('test-lesson-1', 'test-module-1', 'Test Lesson', 'test-lesson', 1);
```

### Error Handling
**Current**: Basic try-catch with generic messages
**Priority**: High

- Categorize errors (syntax, runtime, network, auth)
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls
- User-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
- Structured error logging for debugging

### Security Hardening
**Current**: Basic validation
**Priority**: Medium

## Analytics & Monitoring

### Activity Definition
**Current**: Exercise attempts tracked (Phase 1 complete)
**Goal**: Define and track user activity for engagement metrics
**Note**: `exercise_attempts` table now populated via event bus; `student_progress` aggregates auto-updated

#### What Counts as Activity?
Need to decide which actions constitute "activity" for tracking purposes:

| Action | Counts? | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **Page Load (Authenticated)** | ❓ | Minimum bar - user opened the app |
| **Click "Continue" to current lesson** | ❓ | Shows intent to resume learning |
| **View lesson content** | ❓ | Passive engagement |
| **Run code in editor** | ❓ | Active coding practice |
| **Submit exercise attempt** | ❓ | Explicit learning action |
| **Ask tutor a question** | ❓ | Active engagement with AI |
| **Complete a lesson** | ❓ | Milestone achievement |
| **Idle time on lesson page** | ❓ | May indicate reading/thinking |

#### Proposed Activity Tiers

**Tier 1: Passive Activity** (updates "last seen")
- Loading any authenticated page
- Navigating between lessons
- Opening tutor panel

**Tier 2: Active Engagement** (counts toward daily activity)
- Running code in editor
- Submitting exercise attempts
- Asking tutor questions
- Clicking hints

**Tier 3: Learning Milestones** (achievements/streaks)
- Completing a lesson
- Passing an exercise on first attempt
- Multiple correct submissions in a session

#### Implementation Considerations
- Store `last_activity_at` timestamp on `student_profiles`
- Separate `last_active_date` for daily streak calculation
- Consider debouncing (e.g., multiple code runs within 1 min = 1 activity)
- Decide: Does opening app count for streak, or must user complete something?

#### Open Questions
1. Should page load alone maintain a streak?
2. Minimum engagement time per session?
3. Track per-lesson activity vs global activity?
4. Privacy: How long to retain detailed activity logs?

### Learning Analytics
- Event tracking: lesson start, code execution, hint requests, completion
- Time-to-completion metrics
- Failure pattern analysis
- Hint usage correlation to success rates

### Observability
- Structured logging (JSON format) for production
- Error tracking integration (Sentry/LogRocket)
- Core Web Vitals monitoring
- OpenAI API cost tracking and usage alerts

---

## DevOps & Infrastructure

- Database migration automation
- Environment-specific configs (staging/production)

### Developer Experience
- Pre-commit hooks (lint, type-check)
- Storybook for component documentation
- API mocking (MSW) for local development
- Constants file for magic numbers
